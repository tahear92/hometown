       Dhermi Beach is known for its clear waters surrounded by craggy mountainside. A walkway lined with restaurants and cafes stretches across the length of the beach. Boats that double as water taxis sit beneath cliffside bars, and sun umbrellas cover every inch they can.

          <h4>Visit Old Town</h4>
          <p>
            It's definitely worth strolling around the old stone streets and meet the slow pacing village life. There are a couple of nice churches, like the Church of Saint Charalambos and the Church of Saint Spyridon, each with their pretty clock towers, and the Monastery of Saint Mary on top of the hill.
